# senait antoine assignment 3 collision detection
 The Adventures of Creature with collision detection features.

Original Code was made by Professor Roy Vanegas.

I modified the code to work with certain criteria (different obstacle names, colors, print statements, and positions on the canvas)

I do not claim any of this code other than the modifications to be my own original work. 

This is solely meant to credit the original creator. 

Thank you.
